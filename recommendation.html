								<h2>Creperie </h2>
							</header>
							<h2> 135 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002  </h2>
							<p><a href="http://creperienyc.com/">Creperie</a> is one of my favorite eateries in Manhattan New York City.
								It is a crepe dessert place located near Delancey street on the F and M train of the subway station.
								My favorite dish on their menu is the Famous Crepe (strawberries, bananas, nutella, whipped cream and ice cream).
								I go there often with my friends, and it is one of our to-go-places. It is a great place to sit down, hang out and
								 eat desserts. They also serve chilled drinks. Their space is small,
								 but also gives off a cozy vibe, in which a few friends can share a simple moment
								  together.

							<br>
							<p>Another eatery that I recommend is near Delancy Street is called <a href="http://juicyspotcafe.com/"> Juicy Spot Cafe</a>.
								 Down a couple of blocks from Creperie, the Juicy Spot cafe is located specifically at
								 109 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002. It has a 4.5 rating on yelp and boasts a diverse menu.
								 They have a drink bar and serves fruit smoothies, juices, teas & cold-pressed bottled blends.
								 Although it also occupies a small square feet of space, it is crowded with customers at all times of the day.
							   Their most popular item is their ice cream rolls. My favorite is the Dragonfruit frozen yogurt rolls with
								 strawberry topping and condensed milk drizzle.</p>

							<h2>Soho Thai</h2>
							</header>

							<p> One of my favorite restaurants to go dine in New York, is <a href="http://www.sohothainyc.com/">Soho Thai</a>.
							I don't go there often,	but when I do visit, I go with my sister or a good friend. It is nearly renovated, and located
						  at 141 Grand St, New York, NY 10013. It is near Chinatown, NY and is an easy walk for me
							 whenever I am around the area. My favorite dishes from this restaurant are the Pad See Ew and the Red Curry bowl.
						 I have always been a fan of Thai food, and I believe this place does Thai food a great justice. This place has also been
						  renovated recently, so it looks beautiful.  </p>

							<br>
							<p>One of my favorite drink places to go to in Manhattan is <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mango-mango-dessert-new-york">Mango Mango Dessert</a>.
								Located at 63 Bayard Street, it is in the heart of Chinatown and is highly popular among younger people.
								I love going here once in a while with my friends or family for some dessert or drink. It is a great nice to sit down, hang out and or to just get drinks to go. My favorite
							thing on their menu are their mango vanilla shakes and mango mochi ice cream dish. As an avid mango lover, I can say this is my favorite dessert eatery in Chinatown!</p>

											<h2>Max Brenner</h2>
							</header>
								 <p> Perhaps one of my most favorite places to go dine out with friends is <a href="http://maxbrenner.com/locations/usa/restaurant-nyc/">Max Brenner</a>. The Max Brenner I go to is located in
								   841 Broadway, New York, NY 10003. This brand is spread around the city and is highly popular. Needless to say, this is something I highly recommend
									because it is conveniently located, and their chocolate desserts and drinks are so amazing. My favorite thing on their menu is their chocolate hazlenut milkshake.
								It tastes amazing and you can take it to go whenever you want!</p>
